DEPENDENCIES:
 - socat
 - openvpn
 - byobu
 - lxc
 - A 3.13 or higher kernel with usernamespaces enabled

WHY:
 It's not uncommon to need to be connected to a bunch of overlapping
 VPNs, network namespaces offer an easy way out of that problem.
 Additionally user namespaces offer the ability to run a VPN entirely as
 a user while still sharing the filesystem with the outside allowing all
 your usual commands to work.

 Also, it was a fun way to show how easy it is to work with namespaces
 using the tools provided alongside LXC.

HOW:
 The start-vpn script creates a new user namespace where your user is
 root, then does a few trick so openvpn and byobu can happily run.
 openvpn is then started and a byobu server started so you can easily
 attach inside the container.
